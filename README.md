# League of Legends Champions Info

Welcome to LoL-Champions - a website designed so you can find information on characters from a popular game League of Legends. On the home page you can check different game mods that game has; find a list of all champions. By selecting any of the champions you will be visiting their personalised page that will showcase their roles in the game, short description, abilites, their preview and all currently available skins! This is my passion project, with inspiration taken from Riot official website and their game.

## Features

 * Game mode selection: Arena, Summoners Rift, ARAM, Teamfight Tactics
  
 * Champion search & selection: Using search bar you can find any champion via name, role or difficulty of play.
  
 * Champion styled pages: Each champion has a page specifically designed for them. You can see their role, difficulty, description, abilities and their visual preview and finally skins related to them.

## Technologies Used

### This app is built using a range of modern technologies and best practices:

  * **Javascript & Typescript**: The primary programming language used for the application.

  * **React**: For creating interactive SPA.

  * **SCSS & Bootstrap**: For stylising and ensuring responsive design.

  * **Express**: For making sure server-side can work with CORS.

  * **Slick-Carousel**: For creating and stylising carousel for skins.

  * **Error Boundary**: For handling error in child components and ensuring if there's an error the app doesn't crash.


## Architectural Principles

  **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The application follows OOP principles to promote reusability, scalability, and maintainability.
  ### Separation of Concerns:

  * **Components**: Components have their own folders with styles associated with them and have their own logic.

  * **Assets**: Containing fonts, icons and images.

  * **Services**: Containing champions information for easier access from different components.
